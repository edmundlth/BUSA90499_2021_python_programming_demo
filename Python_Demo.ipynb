    "## Goal for this demo session: \n",
    "---\n",
    "Our main goal in this section is to demonstrate some possible ways you can use Python for \"interesting\" tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics:\n",
    "* How large scale softwares are organised: Functions, Modules and Libraries\n",
    "  - and how to install them. \n",
    "  - Python standard libraries. \n",
    "* Set up a Python environment. \n",
    "  - Grok, REPL, commandline, IDEs\n",
    "  - Basic introduction to Python's package manager. (https://pypi.org/)\n",
    "  - Virtual environment\n",
    "  - Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "* Introduction to some popular external libraries. \n",
    "  - Pandas - R-like dataframes\n",
    "  - Matplotlib - for plotting\n",
    "  - Scipy - scientific computation\n",
    "  - Sklearn - machine learning\n",
    "* Some data exploration\n",
    "* See what billions of operations per second can do for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that: \n",
    "* These are bonus materials and won't be examinable. Emphasis on **demonstrate**, don't worry about the details, the main point is to broaden your idea of what's **possible** with your current skills + a lot of Googling. \n",
    "* None of these are \"profound\" or difficult concepts, but they **can be very complicated** and have a lot of moving parts. \n",
    "* Rather, things you learn in your morning lectures (algorithms, data structures, types, syntax and grammars..), those are things worth spending time understanding. \n",
    "* Ironically, most of a programmer time would probably be spent on \"shallow\" things like these. \n",
    "* One strategy is to learn these on-demand and learn them quickly, then move on to more important things. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Some notes about the Jupyter notebooks themselves\n",
    "---\n",
    " * Well, they are not very well documented. They are meant to be teaching aide where I talk over them rather than for someone reading through it. \n",
    " * They are not even very well written code. It is common for data exploration to be messy and actual clean documented code to be (re-)written afterwards when we understand what we are dealing with and have a good idea of the structure of the program. \n",
    " * These are meant to illustrate things that you can do with Python and some publically available libraries. No attempt is made to make the topics covered exhaustive. "
